The player is presented with a list of controls in order of importance, then with a mission statement from the games' developers. Afterward, the resident researcher of the Kanto region, Professor Oak, appears and introduces new Trainers to the Pokémon world. First, the player is prompted to select their avatar's gender and name, which may be up to seven characters long. Use the Control Pad to move the cursor and the Select Button to cycle through three pages of upper-case letters, lower-case letters, and other characters. On this screen, pressing the A Button will select a letter while pressing the B Button will delete the previous one. When ready, press Start or select OK in the bottom-right corner. Next, Professor Oak introduces his grandson, who happens to be your rival. The professor is having trouble remembering the boy's name, and asks if you might know. Choose his name from a list of preset names, or select a new one. With that done, the player is transported into the world of Pokémon to begin their adventure!",
